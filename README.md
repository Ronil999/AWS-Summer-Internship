# AWS-Summer-Internship

I completed a 4-week online internship on Cloud Computing under the guidance of Amit Arora, a Security Architect at AWS, at AWS Cloud Club Charusat from May 25, 2024 till June 30, 2024. This internship focused on enhancing skills in cloud architecture, covering CloudFront, LLM, Amazon Bedrock, AWS Lambda, AWS API, AWS DynamoDB, and Amazon EC2. Through this experience, I gained practical knowledge and hands-on experience with AWS services. I am excited to apply what I've learned to real-world scenarios and contribute to innovative cloud solutions.
